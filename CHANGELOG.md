# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This repository implements the backend service. The API contract and behavioral definitions live in the spec repository.
Each service release should declare which spec version it implements (see spec.lock).

Notes:
- Spec repo changelog: what the system does (contract/behavior requirements)
- Service repo changelog: what this deployment changes (runtime/ops/migrations) and which spec version is implemented
