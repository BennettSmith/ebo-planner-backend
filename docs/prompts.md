Help me expand this use case to include: 

- Alternate flows 
- Error conditions 
- Authorization rules 

Refer to Overland Trip Planning – v1 Domain Model & Use Case Catalog.md for context.

Provide a complete new version of the markdown file? I want something that is easy to download.

Read through all of the use case markdown files first and then do the following:

- Generate an OpenAPI draft from the **API Notes** sections.
- Add DTO schemas (request/response) to the OpenAPI draft as a follow-on iteration.
